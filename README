* hair brained schemes

GUILE_LOAD_PATH=$HOME/scm

the idea is to depend on guile, but not much else. at some point i'll
need to add .so compiled files to this as well, i imagine the build
system will be tup because the lord said thall shall tup.

* Vendoring & Third Party Code

Run scmvendor to recopy code from the internet, but remember that many
things to be loadable in guile kinda suck, so hacks are generally
placed at the root so I only have one path in my GUILE_LOAD_PATH.
