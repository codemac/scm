* guix packages

This is a set of guix packages for personal use as part of a guix
overlay.

The guix package system needs to search all modules for packages, and
thus cannot handle the libraries I've stuffed around in $HOME/scm as
the guix overlay. GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=$HOME/scm/codemac/guix is
required, otherwise it tries to load everything.

It makes it hard to share code between guix & other scheme, but I
don't have better options for =guix package -s=.
