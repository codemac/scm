;; Announcement: dmd -0.7                           -*- scheme -*-

(define about-this-release
  "This is the second public release of dmd, the `Daemon managing
Daemons' (or `Daemons-managing Daemon'?).  This version adds many
convenient features and is thus a huge step forward, but still it is
experimental software and you should expect it to break.")

(define about-the-software
  "The dmd program is a service manager, i.e. on the GNU system (which
is the primary target), it replaces /sbin/init completely, on systems
which are similar to Unix (e.g. GNU/Linux) it replaces the part of
/sbin/init that is responsible for switching runlevels (/etc/rc?.d and
/etc/init.d come to mind), respawning services (/etc/inittab comes to
mind) and similar things.")

(get-it-from "<http://www.8ung.at/shell/dmd--0.7.tar.gz>")

(define requirements
  "It is written for Guile 1.6.  That is all you need.  Using it with
Guile 1.4 will require small modifications, but better don't bother.")

(define future-directions
  "Various things will be added in the future, including runlevels, an
update-rc.d implementation for Debian, support for existing SysV Init
infrastructure, internationalization, evaluating configuration code in
a sandbox, a graphical interface frontend and many others.")
