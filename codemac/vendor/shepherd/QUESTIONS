Open questions about dmd
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

- Do we need a `requests' field for services?  Service-symbols
  specified there would be started like requirements, but if starting
  all services providing it would fail, we could continue anyway.
  This sounds nice, but it can easiely be emulated by adding to the
  `start' code something like:

    (for-each start '(service1 service2))

  Since this is so simple, I wonder if this functionality is that
  commonly needed that it is worth adding it.  If desired, it would be
  trivial to implement if we don't consider that we might get into
  trouble due to conflicts of these services with other services we
  need to start.

- Do we need a field for services that specifies the global startup
  order, which has a smaller priority than dependencies?  This is
  implemented in Darwins init system and was requested for dmd, but I
  have no idea what that should be good for.  If desired, it would
  probably not be extremely hard to hack it into dmd.  However, a
  better solution might be soft dependencies: "If we start both FOO
  and BAR, start FOO first."
