Announcement: dmd -0.5
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

About this release:
This version (code named "sunflower-seeds-talking-with-pizza-crums")
is a cleanup-release.  Not only the maintainability of the code has
been optimized, the consistency of the user-visible parts has also
been improved (since they have been completely reviewed).  Now we are
well prepaired for some more significant changes.  Note that dmd is
still in a rather early alpha stage of development.

About the software:
The dmd program is a "Daemon managing Daemons" (or "Daemons-managing
Daemon"?), i.e. a service manager, that is entirely written in Guile,
the extension language of the GNU project.  It provides a replacement
for the service-managing capabillities of SysV-init (or any other
init) with a both powerfull and beautiful dependency-based system with
a convenient interface.  It is intended for use on GNU/Hurd, but it is
supposed to work on every POSIX-like system where Guile is available.
In particular, it has been tested on GNU/Linux.

Cheers,
GNU/Wolfgang
