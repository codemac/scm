;; A few notes about the computer this setup is for: It is a PC
;; running Debian GNU/Linux 3.0, on which I am usually using screen,
;; which is why I need few terminals.  I am using it to connect to the
;; internet via ISDN, but I'm also using it in my local network, in
;; which case it is running Apache.  Because I don't want to have
;; Apache running when I am online, I made Apache conflict with the
;; ISDN setup.
