Example configurations for dmd
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This directory contains personal configuration files and interesting
configuration possibilities, the latter being in the files starting
with an underscore character.  You can send me your configuration too
(or your cute configuration code snippets), and I will include it
here, provided that it is available under a license that makes it Free
Software.  Note that for personal configurations I don't want
ChangeLogs, since I won't maintain your configuration anyway :-) but
changes in the snippets should be documented like other changes.

Hint: If you send my your configuration, then not only can other
people learn from it, but I can also make sure that I do not break
your code too often by making incompatible changes, and if I do it
anyway but notice it, I might tell you how to change the code to work
with a new version.
