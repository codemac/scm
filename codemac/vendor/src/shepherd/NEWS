* Changes in version 0.3.1
** Process respawn limit is honored again (regression introduced in 0.3)
** ‘herd status SERVICE’ displays the last respawn time, if any
** (shepherd service) exports ‘&action-runtime-error’ and related bindings
** ‘mkdir-p’ adjusted to cope with GNU/Hurd file system behavior

* Changes in version 0.3

** GNU dmd becomes the GNU Shepherd

The GNU Shepherd herds your daemons!
See http://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/#history for details.
As a side effect, many incompatible changes were made:

  - The ‘dmd’ command was renamed to ‘shepherd’.
  - The ‘deco’ command was renamed to ‘herd’.
  - The default system-wide config file is now /etc/shepherd.scm.
  - The default per-user config file is now ~/.config/shepherd/init.scm.
  - The special ‘dmd’ service is now called ‘root’ and ‘shepherd’.  Thus,
    instead of:
       deco load dmd foo.scm
    you would now type:
       herd load root foo.scm
  - Guile modules now live in the (shepherd …) name space.

** ‘herd status’ and ‘herd detailed-status’ assumes the ‘root’ service

That is, ‘herd status’ is equivalent to ‘herd status root’.

** ‘herd help’ returns a meaningful help message
** ‘shepherd’ stops itself when it receives SIGINT

This is what happens when ‘shepherd’ is running as PID 1 on GNU/Linux and
ctrl-alt-del is pressed (see ctrlaltdel(8)).

** ‘halt’ and ‘reboot’ connect to the system socket unconditionally
** ‘herd’ uses a non-zero exit code upon errors
** The ‘root’ service has a new ‘eval’ action
** Basic man pages are now provided
** ‘make-forkexec-constructor’ has new #:group and #:user parameters
** ‘make-forkexec-constructor’ has a new #:pid-file parameter
** (shepherd services) now exports ‘make-actions’ and ‘provided-by’
** ‘shepherd --pid=FILE’ writes FILE atomically
** The communication protocol is now entirely sexp-based (see the manual)
** ‘shepherd’ is more robust to misbehaving clients
** Cross-compilation is now supported
** The build system uses “silent rules” by default
** Internally, the coding style of various parts has been improved

* Changes in version 0.2

** Non-root configuration file is now ~/.dmd.d/init.scm.

For unprivileged uses of dmd, the configuration file used to be
~/.dmdconf.scm.  It is now ~/.dmd.d/init.scm

** Generate template configuration file when none is found.

A ~/.dmd.d/init.scm template configuration file is now generated when
dmd is started and no such file exists.

** The 'dmd' service has new 'unload' and 'reload' actions.

The 'unload' action allows a service to be stopped and its definition to
be unloaded; 'reload' allows a service to be unloaded, and a new
redefinition to be reloaded, atomically.  See the manual for details.

** 'make-forkexec-constructor' has a new calling convention.

In particular, the procedure now has #:environment-variables
and #:directory arguments.  See the manual for details.

** New 'exec-command' and 'fork+exec-command' convenience procedures.
** The 'status' action displays the running value of services (the PID.)
** 'dmd' has a new '--pid' option.
** Failures to connect to dmd are gracefully handled.
** Data is always appended to the log file.
** Assorted bug fixes and documentation improvements.

* Changes in version 0.1
** A single socket is used for communication with dmd, with a new protocol.

The new communication protocol between 'dmd' and 'deco' is simpler,
versioned, and extensible.

** The default socket name is now independent of the calling user.
** The socket directory is now created under $(localstatedir).
** The 'dmd' service has new actions 'power-off' and 'halt'; 'stop' reboots

When dmd is running as root, as is the case when it is used as a
PID-one init system, these actions allow 'root' to cleanly reboot or
halt the machine.

** New 'reboot' and 'halt' commands.
** 'dmd' only write to stdout when no client is connected.
** The configuration file is loaded in a fresh module.
** 'make-forkexec-constructor' closes all file descriptors after forking.
** License upgraded to GPL version 3 or later.
** Manual license upgraded to FDL version 1.3 or later.
** Many bug fixes, documentation improvements, etc.

* Changes in version -0.4
** Awaken from a 10-year nap.
** Ported to Guile 2.0.
** Modules are modules instead of being loaded.
** Build system fixes, cleanups, and upgrades.

* Changes in version -0.5
** dmd: `--socket=-' instead of `--socket=none'.
** Renamed `extra-action' to plain `action'.
** The result of user-defined stop code is ignored now.
** New action for all services: `dmd-status'.
** Distribution contains file `QUESTIONS'.
** Improved the `unknown' service implementation in `examples/'.
** Number of args given to actions is verified.
** Made docstrings for actions optional.
** Renamed `{en,dis}able-persistency' to `{,no-}persistency'.
** Can pass file name to dmd action `persistency'.

* Changes in version -0.6
** New action `doc' for displaying documentation.
** `list-actions' is a sub-action of `doc' now.
** New action `cd' for dmd, useful with `--socket=none'.
** Distribution contains example for an `unknown' service.
** At configure time, dmd checks for a Guile installation.
** Enable readline on `--socket=none' and non-dumb terminal.
** Startup time finally became completely unacceptable. :-)

* Changes in version -0.7
** Can fork into background via dmd extra-action `daemonize'.
** New action for all services: list-actions.
** New options for dmd: --logfile (-l), and --silent/--quiet
** Standard option --usage works for both dmd and deco.
** You can pass relative file names to deco.
** Never send respawn-output to deco by accident.
** Better handling of terminals and similar services.
** Documented evolution of runlevels.
** Service groups can be used to start/stop services at once.
** Persistency (i.e. safe state on exit and restore next time).
** Invoke actions of service `unknown' (if defined) as fallback.
** Read commands from standard input if socket file name is `none'.

* Changes in version -0.8
** Show output in deco, not only in dmd.
** New options in deco: --insecure (-I) and --result-socket (-r)
** --help displays the options for both dmd and deco.
** Disable services which are respawning too fast.
** New actions for all services: enable, disable and enforce.
** Default extra actions work even when the service is stopped.
** Documented some internals of dmd.

* Changes in version -0.9
** Example configuration added.
** New option for deco: --socket (-s).
** New option for dmd: --insecure (-I).
** Added tutorial and completed documentation.
** Create default socket dir on startup if desired.
** Added a real build system.

* Changes in Version -0.9.6
** Controlling dmd completely with deco is now possible.
** A few bugfixes for service handling.
** Long options can be abbreviated, short ones also work.
** Respawning of services works.

* Changes in version -0.9.7
** User-defined code is always protected with a `catch'.
** New options: --config and --socket.
** The new deco program can be used to send commands to dmd.

* Changes in version -0.9.8
** Starting and stopping of services by symbol works better.
** Performing extra actions on services possible.
** Improved documentation.
** More detailed output.

* Version -0.9.9
** Initial release.
