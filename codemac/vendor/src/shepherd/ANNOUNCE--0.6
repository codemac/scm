Announcement: dmd -0.6
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

About this release:
This version (code named "sunflower-seeds-in-the-keyboard", for no
particular reason) offers no major feature enhancements, but shows
what I consider ``user friendliness'', an aspect that will become more
important over time.  The most interesting improvement of this version
are docstrings.  Descriptions of services and service-specific actions
can be embedded in the code and looked up with the new `doc' action.
Additionally, the dmd distribution now contains a very interesting
example of an `unknown' service (i.e. a handler that gets invoked if
the user wants to operate on a service that does not exist) in the
`examples/' subdirectory.  As usual, various other minor stuff has
been done.

About the software:
The dmd program is a "Daemon managing Daemons" (or "Daemons-managing
Daemon"?), i.e. a service manager, that is written in Guile, the
extension language of the GNU project.  It provides a replacement for
the service-managing capabillities of SysV-init (or any other init)
with a both powerfull and beautiful dependency-based system with a
convenient interface.  It is intended for use on GNU/Hurd, but it is
supposed to work on every POSIX-like system where Guile is available.
In particular, it has been tested on GNU/Linux.

Cheers,
GNU/Wolfgang
